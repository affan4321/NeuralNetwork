# NeuralNetwork
Neural Network is simply a console based application that I made using the concepts of OS. I have developed this in my 4th Semester with my friends Ahmad hassan and Faraz Rashid.
It works on the core concepts of AI neural network~ forward tracking and back tracking phenomenon.
We are using some files as inputs and then as we pass the initial layer, it passes it automatically to the other layers and then it backtracks properly to provide the final output on the screen.
